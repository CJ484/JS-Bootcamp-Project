            This Site was created in 11/13/21 by our CEO Carlos Coreas who was a Student Coder. Although he already knew some
            basic static HTML understanding, He developed this site for his JavaScript Final Project. 
            I was not able to complete the entire project for the ideas that I wanted included when the due date came. After my bootcamp,
            I put this project on hold until I came back with alittle more experience.
